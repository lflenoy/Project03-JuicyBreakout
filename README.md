# Project 03—Juicy Brick-Breaker

Exercise for MSCH-C220

The final step adding "juicy" features to a simple brick-breaker game.


## Implementation
- Added shaders to the main menu background +1
- Added a face to the paddle that reacts to the ball +1
- Added a screen shake when an element is hit +1
- Added sound effects +1
- Added music +1
- Added particles when an element is hit +1

- Made the elements fall and fade off the screen when they are hit +1

- Added a comet trail to the ball +1
- Added eyes +1
- Made the eyes follow the action +1
- Added a background to the game +1

I don't think this is worth any points, but I tried incorporating Halloween colors and music into the game since it is October and I wanted the game to have a Halloween effect to it.
